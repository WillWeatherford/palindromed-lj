## Palindromed Housecall
I cloned and ran Learning Journal by Palindromed. I tested the site for multiple security risks.


### A1: Injection
I attempted to inject a SQL query string into several text inputs on the site, e.g. registration form, login form, comments form etc.
The SQL string selects all passwords from the Users table.
This did not work, as the forms found my input to be invalid in the case of registration and login, or just entered it as escaped text, as in the comments form.
I believe this is because the site uses a Python Object Relational Management system, which does not accept raw SQL string inputs.


### A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management
I attempted to register for the site, but the creator has set it up so that only one person can be registered.
However, after trying a few things, I was able to guess the username "admin" with a password of "admin" and successfully log in to the site with full priveleges.


### A4-Insecure Direct Object References
I was able, kind of, to create an insecure direct object reference. I was able to navigate to http://localhost:6543/post/x where x was any arbitrary post ID.
If this post ID did not exist, the page still loaded, although it was blank. If it did exist, I was able to read the posts.
However, I was not able to edit posts be directly referring to their post id.


### A5-Security Misconfiguration
I was not able to identify any security misconfigurations on the site. Any errors that occurred showed only the status code and a brief status message, without showing any configuration information.
